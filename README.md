## Description

With the namespace "b" I will have a working framework that works with database, server and client.
But without any content. It is the basis for later content.

## ba - database core (common code)

Here is the code for starting and configuring the Postgres server.

### baa - database servers  

For development I will have Postgres in a Linux container. I will add this container to the [Podman pod for development CRUSTDE](https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/crustde_cnt_img_pod). I will use the prepared script in [crustde_install/pod_with_rust_pg_vscode](https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/crustde_cnt_img_pod/tree/main/crustde_install/pod_with_rust_pg_vscode).  
This postgres server listen to localhost port 5432. The administrator user is called "admin" and the default password for now is well known.  
To access Postgres server from windows, I will use VSCode and connect remotely from Windows to CRUSTDE and forward the port 5432.

On google cloud virtual machine my hobby server is so small, that I installed it remotely on Linux.  
Run from Windows git-bash :

```bash
ssh username@server_url
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client
```

### bab - psql the postgres client

[psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) is the command line utility for managing postgres.  
It is very effective.
Auto-completion works ! But not for fields in a table.
History works !
Every sql statement must end with semicolon !
If the result is long, use PgUp, PgDn, End, Home keys to scroll,
then exit scroll with "\q".

```psql
\l     List database
\c     Current database
\c dbname   Switch connection to a new database
\dt    List tables
\dv    List views
\df    List functions
\q     Exit psql shell

-- every sql statement must end with semicolon !
select * from webpage;
select * from hit_counter h;

```

### bac - databases

One server can have many databases.  


### bad - backup and restore

For backup run this from the VSCode terminal inside the project folder.

```bash
pg_dump -F t -U admin -h localhost -p 5432 database_name > db_backup/database_name_2022_11_09.tar
```

For restore run this from the VSCode terminal inside the project folder.

```bash
createdb -U admin -h localhost -p 5432 database_name; 
pg_restore -c -U admin -h localhost -p 5432 -d database_name db_backup/database_name_2022_11_09.tar
```

## bj - server core (common code)

## bs - client core (common code)

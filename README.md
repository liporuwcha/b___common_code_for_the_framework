## b - common code for the framework

With this namespace I will have a working framework that works with database, server and client.
But without any content. It is the basis for later content.

ba - database core (common code)

bj - server core (common code)

bs - client core (common code)

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
